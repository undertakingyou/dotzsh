dotzsh
======

This is Will Smith's personal zsh configuration, based an dotzsh. Dotzsh is a
configuration framework for [Zsh][1] that enriches the command line
interface environment with sane defaults, aliases, functions, auto completion,
and prompt themes.

dotzsh strives to be platform and version independent, some functionality may be
lost when running under older versions of zsh, but it should degrade cleanly and
allow you to use the same setup on multiple machines of differing OS's without
problems.

My additions include my own custom prompt, and some changes to the utility
module to have a few more of my personal aliases. Feel free to contribute, or
fork.

Installation
------------

  1. Clone the repository:

        `git clone --recursive https://github.com/dotphiles/dotzsh.git ~/.zsh`

  2. I like to link the configuration files, which lets me update or pull from
     master and easily have all the changes. To do so, there is a small helper
     script. Do the following:

        `chmod +x ~/.zsh/install.zsh
        ~/.zsh/install.zsh`

     Alternatively, you can create a new Zsh configuration by copying the Zsh
     configuration file templates provided. This will let you edit the zshrc as
     wanted without having it conflict with git upstream.

        `for rcfile in ~/.zsh/templates/z{shenv,shrc,login,logout}; do
          cp -f $rcfile ~/.$rcfile:t
        done`

  3. Set Zsh as your default shell:

        `chsh -s /bin/zsh`

  4. Open a new Zsh terminal window or tab.

### Mac OS X

If you have administrator privileges, you must fix an Apple-introduced problem
in Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard by executing the following command, or BASH and Zsh
will have the wrong `PATH` when executed non-interactively.

    `sudo chmod ugo-x /usr/libexec/path_helper`

`path_helper` is intended to make it easier for installers to add new paths to
the environment without having to edit shell configuration files by adding
a file with a path to the */etc/paths.d* directory.

Unfortunately, `path_helper` always reads paths from */etc/paths* set by Apple
then paths from */etc/paths.d* set by third party installers, and lastly paths
from the `PATH` environment variable set by the parent process, which
ultimately is set by the user with `export PATH=...` Thus, it reorders path
priorities, and user */bin* directories meant to override system */bin*
directories end up at the tail of the array.

### Troubleshooting

If you are not able to find certain commands after switching to *dotzsh*,
modify the `PATH` variable in *~/.zshenv* then open a new Zsh terminal
window or tab.

Usage
-----

dotzsh has many features disabled by default. Read the source code and
accompanying README files to learn of what is available.

### Modules

  1. Browse [~/.zsh/modules/][10] to see what is available.
  2. Load the modules you need in *~/.zshrc* then open a new Zsh terminal window
     or tab.

### Local Modules

  1. Add your own modules to *~/.zsh.local/modules/* to override existing modules.
  2. Load the modules you need in *~/.zshrc* then open a new Zsh terminal window
     or tab.

### Themes

  1. For a list of themes, type `prompt -l`.
  2. To preview a theme, type `prompt -p name`.
  3. Load the theme you like in *~/.zshrc* then open a new Zsh terminal window
     or tab.

### Troubleshooting

  To enable debug timing, add the following to *zshrc*

     zstyle ':dotzsh:load' timing 'yes'
     zstyle ':dotzsh:module:*' timing 'yes'

  `dzinfo` will show which module are loaded and how long they took to start.
